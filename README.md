 # Recommendations
 
 After researching and analysing the IT Setup, I would recommend:
 
 The SaaS it has is easy and convenient to use. In addition, it offers flexibility due to access across devices and geographic regions. It can add users as needed and doesn't require installation, equipment upgrades or traditional licensing management so it's ideal for small businesses that don't have the time, capital, or expertise to build their applications or host applications on-premises.
 
 IaaS leveraging cloud service providers offer pay-as-you-go models, where if you stop your virtual machine, the billing will also stop, which brings significant cost savings and prevents data loss due to backups being taken. in the cloud and increases security.

With this, Butterfly Exchange would increase its sales and have a more complete database, which would facilitate improvement plans and the creation of new projects and save on cloud service providers.
